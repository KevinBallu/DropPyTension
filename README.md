# DropPyTension

## Description
A small project to read drop images, extract drop parameters, and calculate interfacial tension without complex optimization (which makes its use quite straightforward). The interfacial tension measured has an uncertainty of about 1-3 mN/m depending on the measuring conditions.

The code uses the approaches proposed by:  
Andreas, J. M.; Hauser, E. A.; Tucker, W. B. Boundary Tension by Pendant Drops. J. Phys. Chem. 1938, 42 (8), 1001–1019. https://doi.org/10.1021/j100903a002.

In which the 1/H values are calculated from the expressions given in:
